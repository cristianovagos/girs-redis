# GIRS - Redis
A Redis Cluster deployment and management in a clusterized environment.
Ongoing project for GIRS (Gest√£o Integrada de Redes e Sistemas) course of MIECT, at DETI-UA (University of Aveiro).

The project goal is to manage and setup a high-availability service, such as Redis.

### Projects
Here we have ~~two~~ three different approaches, one using Redis Cluster with 6 instances (3 Master / 3 Slave) with HAProxy, other approach is using simply Redis Cluster, and other approach
using a set of 3 Redis Sentinels, and 3 instances (1 Master, 2 Slave). 

Check them out here:
* [**Redis Cluster with HAProxy**](./redis-cluster-haproxy/) (_**recommended**_)
* [~~Redis Cluster~~](./redis-cluster/) (_working but not recommended_)
* [~~Redis Sentinel~~](./redis-sentinel/) (_working but not recommended_)

We recommend the Redis Cluster with HAProxy because it provides features like load balancing, and provides a single 
point of access for client connection.

Read each README for more details and information.
